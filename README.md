# Flight Arrival Delay Prediction with Tidyverse R

## Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an airline dataset to predict flight arrival delay minutes. Using R and the `tidyverse` suite in Jupyter Notebook, I explored several features and characteristics that might impact how long a flight arrives late. The main question addressed is:

**What are the main characteristics that have the most impact on flight arrival delay?**

## Project Structure

- **Data Source**: An airline carrier dataset that includes features such as flight time, weather conditions, and other operational metrics.
  
- **Objective**: To identify key characteristics that affect flight arrival delays, and to develop a model that can predict the delay duration based on these characteristics.

- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data Acquisition: Importing and loading the dataset.
  - Data Wrangling: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing patterns and trends.
  - Feature Selection: Identifying the most impactful characteristics on flight delay.
  - Model Development: Exploring methods to predict delay duration.
  - Model Evaluation and Refinement: Evaluating model performance and improving accuracy.

## Notebooks

- `Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse.ipynb`: Contains the exploratory analysis, feature selection, and prediction model development.
  
## Tools and Libraries

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **R and Tidyverse** (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, etc.)
  
## Key Insights

The analysis focused on identifying key factors affecting flight delays, such as:
- Departure Time
- Carrier Delay
- Carrier Type
- Late Aircraft Delay

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edemekaUSOROH/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-With-Tidyverse.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the analysis.
